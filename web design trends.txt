current internet trends

1. Responsive Web Design
The rise of responsive web design has changed how websites are built. Responsive web design was enabled by additions to the CSS language, like media queries and relative units. These additions allow the presentation of websites to adjust based on the size of the window in which they are displayed.



2. Mobile Applications and Devices
The rise of internet-connected mobile applications has changed the way that we think about browsing the internet. Users accessing the internet on smartphones are likely to spend much more time with specific applications, rather than using their phone’s browser.

Though most mobile applications are internet connected, they are not part of the world wide web. The web is built out of links, whereas mobile applications are designed to keep the user’s attention.

If you want to learn about mobile development, web development is a great place to start! While the majority of mobile applications are built in programming languages, like Swift for iOS, it is increasingly common to see developers using JavaScript frameworks to build new apps.
